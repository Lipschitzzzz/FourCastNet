## Inference:
In order to run FourCastNet in inference mode you will need to have the following files on hand.

1. The path to the out of training sample hdf5 file. This could either be a new set of initial conditions that you downloaded from copernicus and processed yourself (see separate instructions for doing so in the next section), or it could be out_of_sample dataset hosted [here](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=945b3c9e-0f8c-11ed-8daf-9f359c660fbd&origin_path=%2F~%2Fdata%2F). The inference script provided assumes that you are using the ```out_of_sample/2018.h5``` file. You can modify the script to use a different h5 file that you processed yourself after downloading the raw data from Copernicus.
2. The model weights hosted at [Trained Model Weights](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=945b3c9e-0f8c-11ed-8daf-9f359c660fbd&origin_path=%2F~%2Fmodel_weights%2F)
```
FCN_weights_v0/
│   backbone.ckpt  
│   precip.ckpt  
```
3. The pre-computed normalization statistics hosted at [additional](https://app.globus.org/file-manager?origin_id=945b3c9e-0f8c-11ed-8daf-9f359c660fbd&origin_path=%2F~%2Fadditional%2F). It is crucial that you use the statistics that are provided if you are using the pre-trained model weights that we have provided since these stats were used when trainig the model. The normalization statistics go hand-in-hand with the trained model weights. The stats folder contains:
```
stats_v0
│   global_means.npy  
│   global_stds.npy  
│   land_sea_mask.npy  
│   latitude.npy  
│   longitude.npy  
│   time_means.npy
│   time_means_daily.h5
```

Once you have all the file listed above you should be ready to go.

In [config/AFNO.yaml](config/AFNO.yaml), set the user defined paths

```
afno_backbone: &backbone
  <<: *FULL_FIELD
  ...
  ...
  orography: !!bool False 
  orography_path: None # provide path to orography.h5 file if set to true, 
  inf_data_path:       # full path to /out_of_sample. Will not be used while training.
  time_means_path:     # full path to time_means.npy
  global_means_path:   # full path to global_means.npy
  global_stds_path:    # full path to global_stds.npy

```


Run inference using

```
python inference/inference.py --config=afno_backbone --run_num=0 --weights inference/out/backbone.ckpt --override_dir out
```

Additional information on batched ensemble inference and precipitation model inference can be found at [inference/README_inference.md](inference/README_inference.md)

The outputs of the inference scripts will be written to an hdf5 file at the path specified in the ```--override_dir``` input argument. Depending on the params set in the config file, the output file will contain the computed ACC and RMSE of the forecasts and the raw forecasts of selected fields for visualization.

## Inference for a custom interval

The steps will walk you through:
1. Downloading an initial condition from the (continuously expanding) ERA5 dataset to initialize a FourCastNet model.
2. Pre-processing the downloaded ERA5 files
3. Running inference

#### Downloading an initial condition to initialize FourCastNet.

If you are interested in generating a forecast using FourCastNet for a specific time-interval, you should begin by downloading the ERA5 netCDF files for the relevant variables from the Copernicus Climate Change Service Data Store. For convenience, the scripts are provided in [/copernicus](/copernicus). Specifically, you need the two scripts [/copernicus/new_get_pl.py](/copernicus/new_get_pl.py) and [/copernicus/new_get_sfc.py](/copernicus/new_get_sfc.py). These two scripts will respectively download (a superset of) the atmospheric variables on single levels and pressure levels that are modelled by FourCastNet. Be sure to specify the correct time interval in both scripts. While a single temporal snapshot from ERA5 is sufficient to generate a forecast using FourCastNet, you will want to download the ground truth for the full interval you are interested in. This is so that you can analyze the skill of FourCastNet by comparing with the ERA5 ground truth via the RMSE and ACC metrics.

The example scripts show you how to download pl and sl variables in an interval from 19 October 2021 to 31 October 2021. Be sure to download consecutive days only and keep all snapshots at the 0, 6, 12, 18 hour timestamps.

#### Pre-processing

Once you have downloaded the relevant netCDF4 files, you will also need to pre-process them. The pre-processing step simply copies the variables into hdf5 files in the correct order that the trained FourCastNet model expects as input. The pre-processing can be performed using the script [data_process/parallel_copy_small_set.py](data_process/parallel_copy_small_set.py). While the script is MPI capable in order to deal with long time intervals, if your desired interval is short (say a few weeks), you can run it on a single process.

If you don't configure the MPI lib successfully, you can run the script [data_process/serial.py](data_process/serial.py)

The example script shows you how to process pl and sl variables in the time interval from 19 October 2021 to 31 October 2021 that we downloaded in the previous step.

#### Running inference

Follow the general steps listed in the Inference section above. You will need to make appropriate modifications to the [inference/inference.py](inference/inference.py) script.
